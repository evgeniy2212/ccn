<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
            CCN represents to all its users the possibility, in the presence of
            special devices, to connect to the CCN system. Having access to such
            a possible service, all our users will be able to send for temporary
            storage all the serial numbers of banknotes that they have in the
            computer system of CCN. CCN must store all information sent to it by
            users. In the case of illegal withdrawal by outsiders of the
            abovementioned banknotes, the user sends a signal about the crime to
            CCN. CCN in this situation is obligated to send to all users of the
            system the serial numbers of stolen banknotes. When attempting to use
            stolen banknotes, CCN equipment will produce a video and audio record
            of the person who tried to use the stolen banknotes. This record will
            be at the disposal of the police and possibly simplify the detention
            of the criminal.
